# LZ78
This repository contains a basic LZ-78 encoder that I implemented during my time at the University of Melbourne in semester 2, 2016 for the subject titled Foundations of Algorithms. 

The file titled ass2.c is an implementation of an LZ78 encoder using Binary Search Trees, the implementation of the binary search tree is similar to the one provided for COMP10002. 

The second file ass2e_hash.c is an encoder which uses the Hash Table Data Structure in order to achieve a LZ78 encoder. 
ass2d.c was provided to us by the lecturer of the subject, Alistair Moffat and is his work.
